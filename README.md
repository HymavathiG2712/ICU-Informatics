# Predicting the chances of survival of patients 

The dataset includes the highest and lowest values of different tests and conditions within the first 24 hours of patient’s admission

The aim of this study is to identify and predict severity of illness of patient, chances of survival using patient’s demographic data, medical history and EHR records. 

This dataset has a total of 186 columns and 91,714 rows
 
The group decided that if a column has NA or blank values that account for more than 35% of the total number of values, the column would be deleted. 

Null Hypothesis: According to our analysis and algorithms, independent features don’t have relations to the patient's health status and these features don’t predict the negative effect on patient health status. 

Data Preprocessing has been done:
- how many quantitative and qualitative
- how many categories in each category
- any special characters in the cell
- check missing values (fill it with mean)
- check outliers
- Scaling data ( Normalization/ Standardation)
- One hot encoding or Label Encoding
- Feature Selection ( Correlation Matrix, Feature Importance, Chi Square, K- Neighbours)

SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) is a statistical technique for increasing the number of cases in your dataset in a balanced way.
